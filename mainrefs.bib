  abstract = {This report describes the Tyndall Integrated Assessment Scenarios
	project which assesses the
	
	strategies available to reduce UK CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050 relative
	to 1990, a goal adopted by
	
	the UK Government. The study takes a backcasting approach which has
	been applied in two stages.
	
	Initially, a set of credible and consistent end points describing
	the energy system was devised,
	
	outlining alternative visions of a substantially decarbonised society
	in 2050, and using decomposition
	
	analysis to set the boundaries for the generation of the scenarios
	and quantification of the energy
	
	demand trajectories. These end points were used as the basis for a
	backcasting workshop where
	
	experts and stakeholders articulated pathways for the transition to
	the defined futures. Two additional
	
	elements of the project assessed the consequences and implications
	of both end points and pathways,
	
	and the trade-offs between them, by means of a multi-criteria assessment
	framework and the drivers
	
	through which the scenarios may be achieved were further analysed
	using decomposition analysis.
	
	The scenarios are the first to take account of CO2 emissions from
	the whole UK energy system,
	
	including emissions from air, sea and land transport. This work has
	integrated the perspectives of
	
	energy analysts, engineers, economists and social and environmental
	scientists to provide a whole
	
	system understanding of how the UK Government can achieve a true 60%
	CO2 reduction target by
	
	2050. It demonstrates that a 60% reduction in the UKï¿½s CO2 emissions
	is technically achievable, even
	
	when all CO2 sources are taken into account. From the multi-criteria
	assessment a clear consensus
	
	emerges that whilst high energy demand scenarios could be reconciled
	with a 60% reduction in CO2
	
	emissions, the very substantial physical infrastructure required for
	such scenarios would have
	
	significant consequences in terms of sustainability, particularly
	within the natural environment.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a boundary element method (BEM) for cavitating hydrofoils
	moving steadily under a free surface is presented and its performance
	is assessed through systematic convergence studies, comparisons with
	other methods, and existing measurements. The cavitating hydrofoil
	part and the free surface part of the problem are solved separately,
	with the effects of one on the other being accounted for in an iterative
	manner. Both the cavitating hydrofoil surface and the free surface
	are modeled by a low-order potential based panel method using constant
	strength dipole and source panels. The induced potential by the cavitating
	hydrofoil on the free surface and by the free surface on the hydrofoil
	are determined in an iterative sense and considered on the right
	hand side of the discretized integral equations. The source strengths
	on the free surface are expressed by applying the linearized free
	surface conditions. In order to prevent upstream waves the source
	strengths from some distance in front of the hydrofoil to the end
	of the truncated upstream boundary are enforced to be equal to zero.
	No radiation condition is enforced at the downstream boundary or
	at the transverse boundary for the three-dimensional case. First,
	the BEM is validated in the case of a point vortex and some convergence
	studies are done. Second, the BEM is applied to 2-D hydrofoil geometry
	both in fully wetted and in cavitating flow conditions and the predictions
	are compared to those of other methods and of the measurements in
	the literature. The effects of Froude number, the cavitation number
	and the submergence depth of the hydrofoil from free surface are
	discussed. Then, the BEM is validated in the case of a 3-D point
	source. The effects of grid and of the truncated domain size on the
	results are investigated. Lastly, the BEM is applied to a 3-D rectangular
	cavitating hydrofoil and the effect of number of iterations and the
	effect of Froude number on the results are discussed.},

	satisfied at the panel control points of the blade and the aircraft
	panel to achieve coupling of propeller slipstream with the whole
	flow field of the aircraft. At each corresponding azimuth angle of
	the propeller, pressure coefficients and induced velocities by the
	two vortex system at the panel control points were calculated; from
	this, the average aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft in
	one revolution period were obtained, The contraction effect of the
	three-dimensional propeller slipstream and its influence on the flowfield
	were considered in the computation. Results of numerical examples
	showed that the slipstream had a significant effect on aircraft lift
	characteristics such us flap, deflecting, resulting in relatively
	large changes of the aircraft moment performance. Numerical results
	were in good agreement with the experimental data, The method presented
	here is suitable for both single-and multiple-propeller aircraft.},

	of the circumferential vorticity in the upstream boundary layer as
	it encounters the blades, so that the ï¿½boundï¿½ vorticity of the
	blades simply passes through the centrebody surface. The tip vortices,
	which were shown in Part 2 to contain increasing amounts of angular
	momentum as the tip speed ratio increases, are associated with large
	variations in all velocity components and high levels of turbulence.

	to the simple wake models that lead, for instance, to the Betz limit
	and are used in traditional blade element theory. Later papers will
	describe the complex, three-dimensional flow field, the properties
	of the tip vortices, and the process by which the hub ï¿½vorticesï¿½
	may diffuse to form a cylindrical vortex sheet. For the conditions
	giving the largest power coefficient, the bound circulation of the
	blade is approximately constant with radius and the velocity distribution
	immediately behind a blade is similar to that behind an aerofoil
	with the same circulation. This good agreement with aerofoil behaviour
	extends to the highest tip speed ratio measured. At the lowest tip
	speed ratio, the turbulence level in the wake is very high, suggesting
	separation from the blades which are operating at high angles of
	attack. It is also shown that the three-dimensionality does not contribute
	significantly to the balance of angular momentum in the wake. There

  abstract = {An accurate three-dimensional numerical model, applicable to strongly
	non-linear waves, is proposed. The model solves fully non-linear
	potential flow equations with a free surface using a higher-order
	three-dimensional boundary element method (BEM) and a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian
	time updating, based on second-order explicit Taylor series expansions
	with adaptive time steps. The model is applicable to non-linear wave
	transformations from deep to shallow water over complex bottom topography
	up to overturning and breaking. Arbitrary waves can be generated
	in the model, and reflective or absorbing boundary conditions specified
	on lateral boundaries. In the BEM, boundary geometry and field variables
	are represented by 16-node cubic sliding quadrilateral elements,
	providing local inter-element continuity of the first and second
	derivatives. Accurate and efficient numerical integrations are developed
	for these elements. Discretized boundary conditions at intersections
	(corner/edges) between the free surface or the bottom and lateral
	boundaries are well-posed in all cases of mixed boundary conditions.
	Higher-order tangential derivatives, required for the time updating,
	are calculated in a local curvilinear co-ordinate system, using 25-node
	sliding fourth-order quadrilateral elements. Very high accuracy is
	achieved in the model for mass and energy conservation. No smoothing
	of the solution is required, but regridding to a higher resolution
	can be specified at any time over selected areas of the free surface.
	Applications are presented for the propagation of numerically exact
	solitary waves. Model properties of accuracy and convergence with
	a refined spatio-temporal discretization are assessed by propagating
	such a wave over constant depth. The shoaling of solitary waves up
	to overturning is then calculated over a 1:15 plane slope, and results
	show good agreement with a two-dimensional solution proposed earlier.
	Finally, three-dimensional overturning waves are generated over a
	1:15 sloping bottom having a ridge in the middle, thus focusing wave
	energy. The node regridding method is used to refine the discretization
	around the overturning wave. Convergence of the solution with grid

  abstract = {The numerical model for nonlinear wave propagation in the physical

	et al., uses a higher-order BEM for solving Laplace's equation, and
	a higher-order Taylor
	
	expansion for integrating in time the two nonlinear free surface boundary
	conditions. The corners
	
	of the fluid domain were modelled by double-nodes with imposition
	of potential continuity.
	
	Nonlinear wave generation, propagation and runup on slopes were successfully
	studied with this
	
	model. In some applications, however, the solution was found to be
	somewhat inaccurate in the
	
	corners and this sometimes led to wave instability after propagation
	in time.
	
	In this paper, global and local accuracy of the model are improved
	by using a more stable free
	
	surface representation based on quasi-spline elements and an improved
	corner solution combining
	
	the enforcement of compatibility relationships in the double-nodes
	with an adaptive
	
	integration which provides almost arbitrary accuracy in the BEM numerical
	integrations. These
	
	improvements of the model are systematically checked on simple examples

	with refined discretization,

	solution is studied by solving
	
	nonlinear water wave flows in a two-dimensional numerical wavetank.
	The optimum relationship
	
	between space and time discretization in the model is derived from
	these computations and
	
	expressed as an optimum Courant number of ~ 0.5. Applications with

	for the evaluation of singular integrals in stress analysis of elastic

	method (BEM). Triangle polar co-ordinates are used to reduce the
	order of singularity of the boundary integrals by one degree and
	to carry out the integration over mappings of the boundary elements
	onto plane squares. The method was subsequently extended to the cubature
	of singular integrals over three-dimensional internal cells as occur
	in applications of the BEM to three-dimensional elasto-plasticity.
	For this purpose so-called tetrahedron polar co-ordinates were introduced.
	Singular boundary integrals stretching over either linear, triangular,
	or quadratic quadrilateral, isoparametric boundary elements and singular
	volume integrals extending over either linear, tetrahedral, or quadratic,
	hexahedral, isoparametric internal cells are treated. In case of
	higher order isoparametric boundary elements and internal cells,
	division into a number of subelements and subcells, respectively,
	is necessary. The analytical investigation is followed by a numerical
	study restricted to the use of quadratic, quadrilateral, isoparametric
	boundary elements. This is justified by the fact that such elements,
	as opposed to linear elements, yield singular boundary integrals
	which cannot be integrated analytically. The results of the numerical
	investigation demonstrate the potential of the developed concept.},

	of Laplace's equation or Poisson's equation for the electrical potential
	associated with any configuration of current sources that satisfies
	the condition of charge balance, and represents a generalization
	of a well-known result due to Newman applicable to an infinite channel.
	The starting point for the analysis is the very slowly converging
	Fourier-series expansion of the modified Green's function. This Fourier
	series can be separated into a Fourier series in one variable that
	can be summed in closed form, and a double Fourier series that can
	be partly summed with respect to one index and transformed by application
	of the Poisson summation formula and integration by residues. The
	result of applying the Poisson formula can be expressed either as
	a rapidly converging series of logarithmic functions, or as a rapidly
	converging Fourier series which can be integrated analytically with
	respect to the coordinates of the source point. The use of the modified
	Green's function is demonstrated first by determining potential distributions
	that arise from specification of uniform current density on two or
	more of the boundary surfaces. The potential in a cell with two electrodes
	embedded in opposite sides of the rectangle is then calculated, and
	circumstances in which this potential approaches the potential in
	an infinite channel are determined.},

	available to students. There is a huge disparity between the aerodynamics
	covered in typical aerodynamics courses and the application of aerodynamic
	theory to design and analysis problems using computational methods.
	As an elective course for seniors, Applied Computational Aerodynamics
	provides an opportunity for students to gain insight into the methods
	and means by which aerodynamics is currently practised. The specific
	threefold objective is: i) physical insight into aerodynamics that
	can arise only with the actual calculation and subsequent analysis
	of flowfields, ii) development of engineering judgement to answer
	the question ï¿½how do you know the answer is right?ï¿½ and iii)
	establishment of a foundation for future study in computational aerodynamics;
	exposure to a variety of methods, terminology, and jargon.
	
	
	Two features are unique. First, when derivations are given, all the
	steps in the analysis are included. Second, virtually all the examples
	used to illustrate applied aerodynamics ideas were computed by the
	author, and were made using the codes available to the students.
	The exercises are an extremely important component of the course,
	where parts of the course are possibly best presented as a workshop,
	rather than as a series of formal lectures. To meet the objectives,
	many ï¿½old fashionedï¿½ methods are included. Using these methods
	a student can learn much more about aerodynamic design than by performing
	a few large modern calculations. For example (articulated to the
	author by Prof. Ilan Kroo), the vortex lattice method allows the
	student to develop an excellent mental picture of the flowfield.
	Thus these methods provide a context within which to understand Euler
	or Navier-Stokes calculations.},

	closed and periodic three-dimensional vortex sheets situated at the
	interfaces between two inviscid fluids with generally different densities
	in the presence of surface tension are considered. In the mathematical
	formulation, the vortex sheet is described by a continuous distribution
	of marker points that move with the velocity of the fluid normal
	to the vortex sheet while executing an arbitrary tangential motion.
	Evolution equations for the vectorial jump in the velocity across
	the vortex sheet, the vectorial strength of the vortex sheet, and
	the scalar circulation field or strength of the effective dipole
	field following the marker points are derived. The computation of
	the self-induced motion of the vortex sheet requires the accurate
	evaluation of the strongly singular Biot-Savart integral whose existence
	requires that the normal vector varies in a continuous fashion over
	the vortex sheet. Two methods of computing the principal value of
	the Biot-Savart integral are implemented. The first method involves
	computing the vector potential and the principal value of the harmonic
	potential over the vortex sheet, and then differentiating them in
	tangential directions to produce the normal or tangential component
	of the velocity, in the spirit of generalized vortex methods developed
	by Baker (1983). The second method involves subtracting off the dominant
	singularity of the Biot-Savart kernel and then accounting for its
	contribution by use of vector identities. Evaluating the strongly
	singular Biot-Savart integral is thus reduced to computing a weakly

	(large) nonlinearity. Both potential as well as rotational and viscous
	free-surface
	
	flows are considered. For the former, we review mixed-Eulerian-Lagrangian

	methods.

	Eulerian or boundary-fitted grids. The importance and proper treatment
	of viscous
	
	free-surface conditions for these problems are emphasized. We conclude
	
	that computations for nonlinear potential-flow wave problems are reasonably
	
	mature although further developments to improve efficiency and robustness
	are
	
	needed for large complex problems. Nonlinear viscous free-surface
	flow computations
	
	are relatively new. Many of the difficulties such as large Reynolds

	For a plate with initial submergence d starting abruptly from rest
	to constant horizontal velocity U, the problem is governed by a single
	parameter, the Froude number Fn = U/(gd)ï¿½, where g is the gravitational
	acceleration. Depending on Fn, three classes of interaction dynamics
	(subcritical, transcritical and supercritical) are identified. For
	subcritical Fn ([less, similar] 0.7), the free surface plunges on
	both the forward and lee sides of the plate before significant interactions
	with the vortex sheet occur. For transcritical and supercritical
	Fn, interactions between the free surface and the starting vortex
	result in a stretching of the vortex sheet which eventually rolls
	up into double-branched spirals as a result of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
	In the transcritical range (Fn [similar] 0.7ï¿½1.0), the effect of
	the free surface on the double-branched spirals remains weak, while
	for supercritical Fn ([greater, similar] 1.0), strong interactions
	lead to entrainment of the double-branched spiral into the free surface
	resulting in prominent surface features.},

	weak singularities are treated by both the Gauss flux theorem and
	the property of the associated equipotential body. The hypersingularities
	are treated by further using the boundary formula for the associated
	interior problems. The efficacy of the modified formulations is examined
	by a sphere, in an infinite domain, subject to Neumann and Dirichlet
	conditions, respectively.
	
	The modified integral formulations are further applied to a practical
	problem, i.e. surface-wave-body interactions. Using the conventional
	boundary integral equation formulation is known to break down at
	certain discrete frequencies for such a problem. Removing the irregular
	frequencies is performed by linearly combining the standard integral
	equation with its normal derivative. Computations are presented of
	the added-mass and damping coefficients and wave exciting forces
	on a floating hemisphere. Comparing the numerical results with that
	by other approaches demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.},

	With the developed idea, boundary element results converge rapidly

  abstract = {We investigate the free-surface effects on an underwater three-dimensional
	foil undergoing constant translation
	
	and periodic oscillation using a hybrid computational method. In this
	approach, the fluid motion around the foil is
	
	modeled via boundary-integral formulation, and the shed vorticity
	is represented as a shear layer originated from the
	
	trailing edge, while the free-surface waves are resolved by a spectral
	algorithm. We apply this method to investigate
	
	the hydrodynamic forces and free-surface wave signatures of two canonical
	problems of oscillating foils with forward
	
	speed: a horizontal foil undergoing heaving motion and a vertical
	foil in sway motion. In the horizontal-foil case, we
	
	find that the solution has a strong dependence on the unsteady parameter.
	Near the critical value, the mean thrust and
	
	the propulsive efficiency of the foil are significantly reduced, and
	the free-surface wave field is dominated by the
	
	unsteady waves produced by the oscillatory motion rather than the
	steady Kelvin waves due to forward motion. The
	
	surface waves induced by the wake vortices appear as a sequence of
	ringlike patterns along the track. In contrast, for
	
	the swaying vertical foil, the hydrodynamic forces vary smoothly near
	c, while the wake-induced waves exhibit the
	
	characteristic meandering feature.},
