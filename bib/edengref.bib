  abstract = {Based on the assumption that wake geometry of a horizontal-axis wind
	turbine closely resembles that of a hovering helicopter, a method
	is presented for predicting the performance of a horizontal-axis
	wind turbine.^A vortex method is used in which the wake is composed
	of an intense tip-vortex and a diffused inboard wake.^Performance
	parameters are calculated by application of the Bio-Savart law along
	with the Kutta-Joukowski theorem.^Predictions are shown to compare
	favorably with values from a more complicated full free wake analysis
	and with existing experimental data, but require more computational
	effort than an existing fast free wake method.},
