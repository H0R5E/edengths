## CREDITS

This template is an amalgamation of an existing Edinburgh University,
Electrical Engineering PhD Thesis class file (jthesis-v1.cls) authored by
George S Taylor which was released under the GNU GPL.
Code is included from the dmathesis class Written by M. Imran
for a thesis according to the university of Durham regulation, which was
released without copyright. It also contains ideas (possibly code) from the
Princeton thesis class file (PrincetonThesis.cls), authored by Mike Nolta.
Mathew Topper, Eoghan Maguire and Bill Edwards foresaw the need to maintain a
more recent latex implementation of the thesis regulations and thus, this
project was born. It is hoped that the template will be maintained by the
Edinburgh Engineering PhD community once released.
