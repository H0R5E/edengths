%%   ABOUT
%%
%% This is required to start the appendicies for a Latex2e template which
%% corresponds to the regulations regarding layout of a thesis submitted
%% within the University of Edinburgh School of Engineering. It is not
%% `official', but conforms as best as possible to the regulation as detailed
%% at:
%%
%% http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/science-engineering/current-students/
%% research/submitting-thesis
%%
%% Please feel free to alter the template to your own liking, but note that
%% the template is made available under the GNU GPL and must be similarly
%% licenced should you wish to release your modified template.

%%   CREDITS
%%
%% This template is an amalgamtion of an existing Edinburgh University,
%% Electrical Engineering PhD Thesis class file (jthesis-v1.cls) authored by
%% George S Taylor which was released under the GNU GPL.
%% Code is included from the dmathesis class Written by M. Imran
%% for a thesis according to the university of Durham regulation, which was
%% released without copyright. It also contains ideas (possibly code) from the
%% Princeton thesis class file (PrincetonThesis.cls), authored by Mike Nolta.
%% Mathew Topper, Eoghan Maguire and Bill Edwards forsaw the need to maintain a
%% more recent latex implementation of the thesis regulations and thus, this
%% project was born. It is hoped that the template will be maintained by the
%% Edinburgh Engineering PhD community once released.
