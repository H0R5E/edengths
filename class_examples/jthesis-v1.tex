\typeout{PhD Thesis class example}

% Supported options to jthesis:
%	nohyphens 		make hyphenation incredibly unlikely
%				(the university guidelines suggest this)
%				if you get an awakward line you will need
%				to either change it, or use \-
%
%	doublespace		double space eveything except
%				contents, lists of figures etc and references
%				Personally I think double spacing sucks.
%				Use \begin,end{singlespace} for exceptions.
%				(safe to use even when doublespace option
%				 not given)
%
% Other options (not part of jthesis) which you may wish to use:
% twoside - for two sided output
% fleqn - left indented (rather than centered) equations
%
\documentclass[doublespace]{StyleFiles/jthesis-v1}

% By default a eps file of the University Crest is assumed to be
% in the StyleFiles directory. However you may wish to give a full
% absolute pathname here so that xdvi, dvips etc work even when run
% from another directory.
%\crestfile{/home/gst/PhD/Thesis/StyleFiles/EdUniCrest.eps}

% The array package extends tabular, for example useful for <{$},>{$}
% when using tables of symbols
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage{array}

% It is recommended you use amsmath for better looking equations,
% but the jthesis class does not enforce this.
\usepackage{amsmath}

% Use subfigure to put multiple figures into one - complete with
% mini captions.
%\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{subfig}

% Other useful packages you might not otherwise find out about:

\usepackage{booktabs}
% \usepackage{psfrag}	% replace labels in xfig diagrams with nice math
% \usepackage{endfloat} % put all floats at end
% \usepackage{shadow}   % for shadowed boxed round things
% \usepackage{bar}	% for bar charts
% \usepackage{draftcopy} % prints DRAFT across each page in big grey letters
% \usepackage{mathtime}  % for times font style maths (may require some fonts)
% see also the documentation for the graphicx package providing
% support for postscript images and colour (already \usepackage'd)

\usepackage{dcolumn}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage{lscape}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{rotating}

% Tip: If you include your own .sty/.cls files with \usepackage
% instead of \include separate .aux files will not be generated for
% each included file.
%\usepackage{StyleFiles/mymacros}


% Tip: use \includeonly to only include one thing and ignore all other
% \include commands, this is handy for formatting only one chapter
% at a time
%\includeonly{Chapter1/chapter1}
